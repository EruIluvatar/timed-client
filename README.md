Timed - Commandline client and python library
=============================================

Timed is our new and fancy time tracking tool. To find out more, check it out here:

* [Frontend](https://github.com/adfinis-sygroup/timed-frontend)
* [Backend](https://github.com/adfinis-sygroup/timed-backend)


This tool aims to be a commandline interface, so you don't need a web browser to keep
track of your work.

Status, contributing
--------------------

This is very much a work in progress. As the details are not fleshed out yet,
and architecture may change at any time, I don't encourage active contributions
at the moment, at least not without contacting me. This will change once it's in
a roughly stable shape, however.

What works so far
-----------------

The client can login (and will store token on disk). After logging in, you can
query your overtime balance and employment information. That's about it, for now.
More (much more) is coming soon!
